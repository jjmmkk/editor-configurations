# PhpStorm

## Installation

Copy the contents of the directory **"config"** into the corresponding locations in **~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm/**. Be careful not to replace existing directories.

The **"PhpStorm"** directory is probably suffixed by the version number.

Open PhpStorm and select "JM" as the keymap and as the color scheme.
