## Installation

Copy the contents of the directory **"config"** into the corresponding locations in **~/Library/Preferences/<APP>/**, .e.g. **~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJ/** or **~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm/**. Be careful not to replace existing directories.

The **<APP>** directory is probably suffixed by a version identifier.

Open the application and select "JM" as the keymap and as the color scheme.
